= naturally_sorted_pathname

Pathname with natural order sorting behavior. Useful for sequences of files that
come from Ghostscript, ImageMagick, FFMpeg or special hardware and software and have
file number in it, or just human-readable file listing.

With natural order sorting page_02.png comes before page_11.png, while with
alphabetic it is the other way around.
